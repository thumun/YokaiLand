# YokaiLand

Originally developed as a table top game with a Python component for my final project for EALC 121 (Myth, Folklore, and Legend in Japan) 
In accordance with being a final project, I used sources from texts/other media that we learned about in class (these sources can be seen in the Yokai Land game rules). 

Currently, I am in the process of turning into a digital board game using Unity and C#. 
I will also design some assets to make the combat more entertaining.
