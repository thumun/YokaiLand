How to run the game (on the computer - tutorial assuming you have a mac system) 

download prototypeealc.py -- (please save to desktop) 
Open: Terminal
Type: ls
Type: cd Desktop 
Type: python3 prototypeealc.py

If it says command is not working (still in Terminal): 

Copy/Paste: /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
Copy/Paste: export PATH="/usr/local/opt/python/libexec/bin:$PATH"
